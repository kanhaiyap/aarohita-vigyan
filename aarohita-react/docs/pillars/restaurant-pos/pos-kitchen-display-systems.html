    <h1>Kitchen Display Systems & POS</h1>
    <p>Kitchen Display Systems (KDS) replace paper tickets with digital screens that show orders in real time. When tightly integrated with your POS, a KDS improves order routing, reduces mistakes and shortens ticket times — which directly improves guest satisfaction and throughput.</p>

    <h2>Why KDS matters for restaurants</h2>
    <p>Modern kitchens run on timing and coordination. A KDS provides: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear visual routing of orders by station and priority</li>
      <li>Automated acknowledgements to prevent missed tickets</li>
      <li>Order timers and visual alerts for delays</li>
      <li>Better data for kitchen performance and training</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrating KDS with POS</h2>
    <p>Integrations typically push orders from the POS to the KDS in structured formats (itemized lines, modifiers, prep notes). Choose a POS that supports realtime webhooks or a native KDS integration. Test edge cases: voids, refunds and reprints to ensure the KDS stays in sync.</p>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra — voice ordering + POS/KDS automation</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> is Aarohita Vigyan's voice-enabled assistant that captures orders hands-free and sends structured order payloads to your POS and KDS. Its benefits for kitchens include reduced misreads, faster order capture, and multilingual recognition for diverse staff and customers.</p>

    <h3>Practical tips</h3>
    <p>When adding Bhojan Mitra and a KDS to your setup:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with a pilot: map common order flows and test voice recognition in noisy kitchen conditions.</li>
      <li>Integrate with your POS API or use middleware that translates voice payloads into POS-compatible orders.</li>
      <li>Train staff on KDS workflows and fallback procedures if network issues occur.</li>
    </ol>
