    <h1>Cloud POS vs On-Premise POS</h1>
    <p>Cloud POS systems provide centralized management, faster feature updates and simpler integrations (APIs, webhooks), making them a popular choice for most small and medium restaurants. On-premise POS keeps data locally and can be preferable when you need maximum control over infrastructure, reduced monthly subscriptions and specialized compliance constraints.</p>

    <h2>Key differences summarized</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deployment & updates:</strong> Cloud POS pushes automatic updates; on-premise requires local upgrades and testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Cloud POS generally offers easier, documented APIs for connecting delivery platforms and voice assistants like Bhojan Mitra.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> On-premise can be less dependent on internet, but modern cloud POS with offline-first features gives the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Cloud POS shifts costs to predictable subscriptions; on-premise often has higher upfront costs but lower recurring fees depending on vendor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing by business model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single outlet / café:</strong> Cloud POS for faster setup and minimal IT overhead.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery-first kitchen:</strong> Cloud POS with robust marketplace integrations and offline resilience.</li>
      <li><strong>Large multi-location brand:</strong> Consider hybrid: local resiliency plus central cloud orchestration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra — voice-enabled, offline-resilient ordering</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> integrates with both cloud and on-premise POS systems via standard APIs or middleware. For cloud-first setups, Bhojan Mitra uses webhooks and REST APIs to post structured orders directly into the POS. For on-premise or constrained networks, Bhojan Mitra supports local caching of voice captures and reliable sync to the POS once connectivity is available.</p>

    <h2>Decision checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Test offline behaviour: simulate network loss and validate reconciliation.</li>
      <li>Confirm API/webhook examples and plan Bhojan Mitra integration testing.</li>
      <li>Estimate 3-year total cost of ownership (subscription + hardware + support).</li>
    </ol>
