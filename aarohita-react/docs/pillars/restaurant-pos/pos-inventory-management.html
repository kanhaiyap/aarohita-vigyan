    <h1>Inventory Management with POS</h1>

    <p>Accurate inventory is the backbone of a profitable kitchen. When your POS is connected to inventory and recipe-level usage, each sale can decrement ingredients automatically and trigger reorder alerts when par levels are reached. This reduces spoilage and improves margins.</p>

    <h2>Key capabilities to look for</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recipe-level consumption:</strong> map menu items to ingredient quantities so stock reduces automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Par-level & reorder rules:</strong> set minimum stock alerts and automated purchase orders to suppliers.</li>
      <li><strong>Batch & expiry tracking:</strong> for perishable ingredients, link batches and expiry dates to avoid waste.</li>
      <li><strong>Waste & wastage capture:</strong> record prep waste and use it to refine forecasts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Forecasting from POS data</h2>
    <p>Even simple rolling averages from POS sales can drive weekly purchase lists. Couple POS sales data with seasonality (weekend vs weekday) to improve ordering and reduce stockouts.</p>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra — improving order accuracy and inventory signals</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> reduces order-entry mistakes by capturing spoken orders at the counter or at the phone. Fewer data entry errors mean inventory reductions are reliable, giving better forecasts and less shrinkage.</p>

    <h2>Operational tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Train staff to use modifiers and combos correctly — inconsistent item selection is a major source of inventory mismatch.</li>
      <li>Run weekly reconciliations for high-value items and refine recipe yields periodically.</li>
      <li>Use supplier lead-time buffers and safety stock for perishable, hard-to-source ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
