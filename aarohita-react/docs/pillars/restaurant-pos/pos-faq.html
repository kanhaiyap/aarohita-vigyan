    <h1>POS FAQs for Restaurant Owners</h1>
    <p>Below are practical answers to common questions about POS selection, deployment and operations. If you need a tailored answer, <a href="/#contact">contact our team</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. What is the difference between cloud and on-premise POS?</h2>
    <p>Cloud POS stores data centrally and offers faster updates and integrations; on-premise keeps data local and may have different reliability characteristics. Many businesses prefer hybrid models that combine local resilience with cloud sync.</p>

    <h2>2. How do refunds and chargebacks work?</h2>
    <p>Refunds should be recorded in the POS with the original transaction reference. For card chargebacks, reconcile with your payment provider's reports and keep detailed audit trails.</p>

    <h2>3. How long does it take to deploy?</h2>
    <p>A small café can deploy in days. Larger installations with integrations and multi-outlet rollouts typically need 2–6 weeks of planning, testing and staff training.</p>
