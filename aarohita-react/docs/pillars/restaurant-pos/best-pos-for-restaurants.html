    <h1>Best POS Systems for Restaurants in 2025</h1>

    <p>Choosing the right Point of Sale (POS) is one of the most important operational decisions for restaurants, cafes and cloud kitchens. In 2025, modern POS platforms combine cloud-sync reliability, robust payment integrations (UPI, cards, wallets), inventory and kitchen automation. This guide helps restaurateurs select the right system based on business size, transaction volume and integration needs.</p>

    <h2>Quick comparison — which POS fits your business?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single café / kiosk:</strong> lightweight cloud POS, low monthly fees, easy hardware pairing.</li>
      <li><strong>Growing restaurant:</strong> inventory, loyalty, delivery integrations and reporting dashboards.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud kitchen / delivery-first:</strong> multi-channel order routing, automatic delivery reconciliation and KDS support.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-location / franchise:</strong> centralized menu management, role-based access and aggregated analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selection checklist — what to prioritise</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Payment methods & reconciliation: UPI, cards, wallets and settlement time.</li>
      <li>Offline-first reliability: local queueing, retries and safe reconciliation after outages.</li>
      <li>Inventory & waste tracking: automatic stock decrement, recipe-level tracking.</li>
      <li>Kitchen & fulfilment integration: KDS, printer routing and delivery aggregator hooks.</li>
      <li>Reports & alerts: daily cashup, sales by item, and anomaly detection.</li>
      <li>Hardware compatibility & total cost (devices, printers, barcode scanners).</li>
      <li>Third-party APIs and extensibility for integrations like Bhojan Mitra.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Implementation steps (pilot & scale)</h2>
    <p>Run a 30-day pilot on a single outlet. Use real transactions to test reconciliation, refunds and edge cases. Document staff workflows and train a small group of power users before rolling out across other outlets.</p>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra — voice-enabled POS assistant</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> is Aarohita Vigyan's multilingual voice assistant designed to integrate with POS and KDS systems. Features include voice ordering, verbal confirmations for staff, and natural-language queries for reports ("show today's top sellers"). For high-volume kitchens, voice ordering reduces keystrokes and speeds service while maintaining audit trails for reconciliation.</p>

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <h3>How much should I budget?</h3>
    <p>Expect subscription fees from ₹500–₹2,000/month for basic cloud POS solutions in India, with additional one-time hardware costs (₹8k–₹25k) depending on devices.</p>

    <h3>Is offline mode safe for payments?</h3>
    <p>Offline mode should queue orders locally and avoid capturing card payments offline; use payment terminal confirmations and reconcile on reconnect to prevent double-charges.</p>
