        content: `
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Choosing between React Native and Flutter remains one of the most common decisions for teams building cross-platform mobile apps. Both frameworks are mature in 2025: React Native has a huge ecosystem and a familiar JavaScript/TypeScript developer base, while Flutter provides a single rendering engine, consistent UI across platforms and excellent performance thanks to Dart ahead-of-time compilation.</p>

          <h3>Developer experience & ecosystem</h3>
          <p>React Native benefits from the broader JavaScript ecosystem—libraries, tooling, and a large developer pool in India. If your team already has React experience, onboarding is fast. Flutter's Dart language requires learning a new syntax, but many teams find Flutter's integrated tooling (hot reload, widget catalog) makes UI development faster and more predictable.</p>

          <h3>Performance & UI fidelity</h3>
          <p>Flutter generally offers closer-to-native performance because it controls every pixel with its rendering engine. React Native uses native components and a bridge; with modern architectures like Fabric and TurboModules, performance gaps have narrowed. For highly animated, bespoke UI experiences, Flutter can be easier to tune; for apps that rely on native platform widgets, React Native shines.</p>

          <h3>Integration with native features & third-party SDKs</h3>
          <p>Both frameworks provide ways to write native modules for platform-specific features. React Native's long history yields many mature community packages for payment gateways, push notifications and analytics. Flutter also has a growing plugin ecosystem; when a plugin is missing, Flutter's FFI and platform channels make writing a bridge straightforward.</p>

          <h3>When to choose React Native</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your team already uses React and JavaScript/TypeScript.</li>
            <li>You want to share code with a web frontend or limit the learning curve.</li>
            <li>You need mature packages for payments, maps, or third-party SDKs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When to choose Flutter</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You need high UI fidelity and consistent behavior across devices.</li>
            <li>You prefer a single rendering stack with reduced platform-specific quirks.</li>
            <li>You want smaller variation between Android and iOS rendering and smoother animations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cost & talent in India</h3>
          <p>React Native hiring is slightly easier due to JavaScript familiarity; Flutter talent is growing rapidly and offers strong value for UI-heavy apps. For startups with rapid iteration needs, React Native teams may ship faster. For consumer apps where polish matters, Flutter is a compelling choice.</p>

          <h3>Recommendation</h3>
          <p>Run a 2–4 week spike with a representative feature: build the same screen and core flow in both frameworks, benchmark performance and developer velocity. Use that pilot to pick the best fit for your product and team.</p>

        content: `
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Startups often rush to build features without validating assumptions. Here are the most common mistakes we see—and how to avoid them.</p>

          <h3>1. Building too many features before product-market fit</h3>
          <p>Focus on the smallest feature set that validates your core hypothesis. Each additional feature increases complexity, slows feedback loops and raises costs.</p>

          <h3>2. Ignoring onboarding and first-time user experience</h3>
          <p>Users judge an app in the first 30–60 seconds. Invest in progressive onboarding and reduce friction for primary tasks.</p>

          <h3>3. Not instrumenting product usage</h3>
          <p>Without analytics you’re flying blind. Track key funnels, retention and error rates to make data-driven decisions.</p>

          <h3>4. Underestimating performance and device fragmentation</h3>
          <p>Optimize for low-end devices, especially in price-sensitive markets. Profiling and selective image/video loading go a long way.</p>

          <h3>5. Poor communication with engineering teams</h3>
          <p>Establish clear priorities, acceptance criteria and a single source of truth for designs. Regular demos and iterations prevent misaligned expectations.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Avoiding these mistakes requires discipline: define the riskiest assumptions, build measurable experiments, and iterate based on real user feedback.</p>

          <h3>Startup cost of performance work</h3>
          <p>Invest early in profiling tools and performance budgets. Small fixes—asset compression, lazy loading, and efficient lists—often yield large improvements.</p>

          <h3>Practical optimizations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Optimize images and use responsive formats (WebP/AVIF for web, appropriate sizes for mobile).</li>
            <li>Use virtualization for long lists (FlatList with windowing in RN or equivalent).</li>
            <li>Avoid heavy synchronous work on the UI thread; offload to background threads where possible.</li>
            <li>Caching strategies for API responses and thumbnails to reduce perceived latency.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Monitoring & KPIs</h3>
          <p>Track app startup time, time-to-first-interaction, and memory usage. Set alerts for regressions and measure user retention after performance improvements.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Performance is an ongoing investment. Prioritize fixes with the largest user impact and make profiling part of your CI process.</p>

          <h2>Security is non-negotiable</h2>
          <p>Mobile apps handle sensitive data—user credentials, payments and personal information. Treat security as a product requirement, not an afterthought.</p>

          <h3>Authentication & authorization</h3>
          <p>Use proven identity providers (OAuth2/OpenID Connect) and avoid roll-your-own auth. Implement least-privilege access and short-lived tokens with refresh flows.</p>

          <h3>Data protection</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Encrypt sensitive data at rest using platform-provided secure storage.</li>
            <li>Use TLS everywhere and pin certificates when high assurance is needed.</li>
            <li>Minimize sensitive data collection and purge when no longer needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>App integrity & supply chain</h3>

          <p>AI features add product value but also operational complexity. Begin with a single feature—image recognition, summarization, or recommendations—and iterate with user feedback.</p>

          <h3>Cloud APIs vs on-device</h3>
          <p>Cloud APIs (LLMs, vision, speech) are fast to prototype but add latency and cost. On-device models improve latency and privacy but require optimization (quantization, pruning).</p>

          <h3>Architecture patterns</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Edge inference:</strong> Run lightweight models locally for instant responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Use on-device models for common cases and cloud fallbacks for heavy tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Server-side processing:</strong> For heavy training or personalization pipelines.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data collection & privacy</h3>
          <p>Obtain explicit consent for telemetry and training data. Anonymize and enforce retention policies to stay compliant with privacy regulations.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Integrating AI into apps is most successful when you measure hypotheses early, prioritize privacy-friendly designs and choose a hybrid deployment model that balances cost and experience.</p>

        content: `
          <h2>Overview of common models</h2>
          <p>Choosing the right monetization model depends on your audience and product. Common options include ads, subscriptions, in-app purchases, freemium tiers and enterprise licensing.</p>

          <h3>Ads</h3>
          <p>Ads work well for high-traffic consumer apps but can hurt retention if intrusive. Use native, rewarded or contextual ads strategically and measure lifetime value carefully.</p>

          <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
          <p>Subscriptions provide predictable revenue for services with ongoing value—content, productivity or cloud features. Focus on reducing churn and offering clear recurring value.</p>

          <h3>Freemium & in-app purchases</h3>
          <p>Offer a free core experience with paid upgrades for premium features. Ensure the free layer is useful to drive adoption while premium features are compelling enough to convert.</p>

          <h3>Enterprise & B2B</h3>
          <p>White-labeling, integrations and SLAs can justify higher enterprise pricing. Sales cycles are longer but deal sizes are larger and more stable.</p>

          <h3>Choosing the right model</h3>
          <p>Validate with small experiments: A/B test pricing, offer trials, and measure conversion and retention metrics. Align pricing with customer willingness to pay and the value you deliver.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>No single model fits all; combine approaches (e.g., freemium + ads for non-paying users) and iterate based on user feedback and unit economics.</p>
