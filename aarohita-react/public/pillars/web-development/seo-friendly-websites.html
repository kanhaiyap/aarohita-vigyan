    <h1>How to Build SEO-Friendly Websites</h1>
    <p>SEO-friendly websites balance great UX, performance and semantic HTML. Start with clear headings (H1/H2), descriptive meta titles and descriptions, and structured data (JSON-LD) for entities and articles. Optimize images, serve critical CSS inline and defer non-critical scripts to reduce time to first meaningful paint.</p>

    <h2>Technical considerations</h2>
    <p>Implement server-side rendering or pre-rendering for content pages, use canonical URLs, and ensure crawlable navigation. Use sitemaps and robots.txt to guide crawlers and validate pages with Search Console tools.</p>

    <p>This is a starter outline—expand with checklist items, example markup and a testing workflow for developers and content teams.</p>
