    <h1>Why React + Django is an Excellent Stack in 2025</h1>
    <p>React and Django together provide a pragmatic, scalable stack for web applications. React handles dynamic, interactive frontends with component-driven development and rich ecosystems for state management and UI; Django provides a mature, secure backend with batteries-included features like admin, auth, and ORM. This combination lets teams ship fast while keeping long-term maintainability.</p>

    <h2>When to use this stack</h2>
    <p>It’s a great fit for content-driven apps that still need complex interactions—dashboards, admin portals, marketplaces and SaaS. API-first development with Django REST Framework or GraphQL enables mobile apps and third-party integrations to reuse the same backend.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear separation of concerns (frontend UX vs backend logic)</li>
      <li>Large talent pool and ecosystem support</li>
      <li>Good for SEO when combined with server-side rendering or prerendering</li>
    </ul>
