    <h1>Offline Mode & Reliability for POS</h1>
    <p>Network outages happen. A robust POS should continue accepting orders, print receipts and sync once connectivity returns. Aarohita Vigyan's POS guidance explains offline-first design patterns and operational checks that keep restaurants running.</p>

    <h2>Why offline mode matters</h2>
    <p>For restaurants, even short downtimes mean lost revenue. Offline mode ensures orders are captured locally and reconciled later — critical for high-volume kitchens and cloud kitchens alike.</p>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra & offline resilience</h2>
    <p>When integrated with Bhojan Mitra — our voice-enabled assistant — offline flows should cache voice commands locally and confirm orders on reconnection, preventing duplicate charges and ensuring customer trust.</p>

    <h3>Quick checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Local data queueing with retry and deduplication</li>
      <li>Graceful fallback UI for staff</li>
      <li>Safe storage & encryption of queued orders</li>
    </ul>
