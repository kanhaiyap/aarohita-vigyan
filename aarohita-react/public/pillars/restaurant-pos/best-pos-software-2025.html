    <h1>Best POS Software in 2025 — Curated for Indian Restaurants</h1>

    <p>There is no one-size-fits-all POS. Choose software by matching features to your operational needs. Below we describe vendor tiers and provide practical guidance for shortlisting and piloting software in Indian market conditions.</p>

    <h2>Vendor tiers and when to choose them</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entry-level:</strong> Simple cloud POS, low monthly cost — best for single cafes, kiosks and food trucks.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-market:</strong> Inventory, loyalty, and delivery integrations — suitable for restaurants and small chains.</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Centralized management, advanced APIs and SLAs — aimed at large multi-location brands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shortlisting criteria (practical checklist)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Payment & settlement options (UPI, cards, wallets) and daily settlement reports.</li>
      <li>Offline capability and safe reconciliation flows after network recovery.</li>
      <li>Delivery aggregator integrations and deduplication logic.</li>
      <li>API/webhook support for third-party integrations (Bhojan Mitra, accounting, analytics).</li>
      <li>Hardware compatibility and device lifecycle support in India.</li>
      <li>Support SLAs, training and local presence for faster issue resolution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra compatibility</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> was designed to work with standard POS APIs and webhooks. It captures voice orders in multiple Indian languages and converts them into structured POS orders, reducing entry errors and saving staff time. When evaluating vendors, confirm request/response examples and webhook behaviour to accelerate integration.</p>

    <h2>Pilot plan (30–60 days)</h2>
    <p>Run a pilot in a busy shift: test deliveries, refunds, split bills and end-of-day cashup. Validate nightly reconciliations and record any behavioral edge-cases. If Bhojan Mitra is used, measure order accuracy improvements and staff time savings during the pilot.</p>
