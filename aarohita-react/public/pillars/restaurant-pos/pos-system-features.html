    <h1>Essential POS System Features for Restaurants</h1>

    <p>Modern restaurant POS platforms are modular: the core order-taking and payments modules must be rock-solid, while add-ons such as loyalty, CRM and analytics provide operational leverage. Focus first on reliability and then on automations that reduce manual work.</p>

    <h2>Core modules (must-have)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order entry & menu management:</strong> fast SKU lookup, modifiers, portion control and templates for popular combos.</li>
      <li><strong>Payments & settlement:</strong> UPI, cards, wallets and automatic settlement reporting; support for partial payments and split bills.</li>
      <li><strong>Offline resilience:</strong> local queuing, safe storage and idempotent reconciliation to avoid duplicate orders.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory & recipe mapping:</strong> ingredient-level tracking, waste capture and automatic re-order triggers.</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen routing & KDS:</strong> ticket routing, prep timers and prioritisation for multi-station kitchens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational add-ons (high ROI)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Loyalty & CRM: customer profiles, rewards and targeted offers based on POS events.</li>
      <li>Delivery & marketplace integrations: auto-ingest orders from aggregators and avoid manual entry errors.</li>
      <li>Reporting & analytics: scheduled reports, anomaly detection and drill-down dashboards.</li>
      <li>APIs & webhooks: enable headless integrations and custom automations (for example, with Bhojan Mitra).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra — how voice fits into features</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> brings voice-first flows into the feature stack: voice order capture that writes directly to the POS, verbal confirmations for staff, and natural-language queries to get sales summaries. For training-limited environments, voice reduces onboarding time.</p>

    <h2>Checklist for vendor evaluation</h2>
    <p>Ask vendors for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uptime and offline behaviour documentation</li>
      <li>Sample API docs and webhook examples</li>
      <li>Reference sites in your city/segment</li>
      <li>Security and compliance posture (encryption, PCI stance)</li>
    </ul>
