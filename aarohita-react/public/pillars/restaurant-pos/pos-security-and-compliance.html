    <h1>POS Security & Compliance</h1>

    <p>Protecting payment and customer data is essential. A secure POS combines technical controls, operational procedures and compliance practices. Small restaurants and large chains can follow the same basic principles scaled to their size.</p>

    <h2>Technical controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Role-based access:</strong> limit sensitive actions (refunds, price changes) to authorised staff and maintain audit logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> TLS for network traffic and encrypted storage for any sensitive local caches.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment flows:</strong> prefer tokenised card terminals and avoid storing card PANs in your systems; use PCI-compliant providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily cash reconciliations and automated alerts for unusual refund patterns.</li>
      <li>Regular software updates for tills and peripheral firmware.</li>
      <li>Periodic staff training on social engineering and proper payment handling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compliance in India</h2>
    <p>For tax and regulatory compliance, ensure your POS prints GST-compliant invoices (with HSN/SAC where needed) and can export monthly sales reports for your accountant. Work with providers who understand local GST flows and can help with e-invoicing where applicable.</p>

    <h2>Bhojan Mitra & secure voice ordering</h2>
    <p>Bhojan Mitra captures voice commands but does not store payment credentials. Voice confirmations are recorded as audit trails and linked to POS orders to support dispute resolution.</p>
