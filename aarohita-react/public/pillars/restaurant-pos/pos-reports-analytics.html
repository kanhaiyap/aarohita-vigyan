    <h1>POS Reporting & Analytics</h1>

    <p>Actionable reporting turns daily transactions into strategic decisions. A modern POS should provide sales by item, hourly throughput, table turn, void and refund analysis, and labor cost dashboards to help managers optimise staffing and menus.</p>

    <h2>High-value reports to track</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales by item & category:</strong> remove low-performing dishes and promote high-margin items.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales by hour / shift:</strong> staff appropriately for peak periods.</li>
      <li><strong>Voids and refunds:</strong> monitor patterns to reduce loss and identify training needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Inventory vs sales variance:</strong> detect shrinkage and improve ordering accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data quality & Bhojan Mitra</h2>
    <p><strong>Bhojan Mitra</strong> improves data quality by capturing accurate, multilingual orders and reducing manual mistakes. Higher-quality POS input enables better forecasting and reliable dashboards.</p>

    <h2>Visualisations & alerting</h2>
    <p>Prefer POS tools that offer scheduled reports and alerting for anomalies (sudden sales drop or unexpected refunds). Integrate with Slack/WhatsApp for critical alerts to managers during service hours.</p>
