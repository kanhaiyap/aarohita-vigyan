    <h1>Compare Top POS Systems</h1>

    <p>When comparing POS systems, map each vendor to your operational needs: payments, inventory, delivery integrations, KDS, and reporting. Use the table below as a mental model for where each vendor type fits.</p>

    <h2>Comparison framework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Feature breadth:</strong> core order/payment features vs advanced modules (CRM, loyalty, forecasting).</li>
      <li><strong>Integration surface:</strong> API availability, webhook behaviour and connector ecosystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational fit:</strong> offline behaviour, hardware compatibility and local support presence.</li>
      <li><strong>Total cost:</strong> subscription, per-device fees and hardware lifecycle costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to run a fair comparison</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Define 6–8 critical flows (billing, refund, delivery order, split bill, cashup).</li>
      <li>Rate vendors on those flows and measure engineering effort to integrate Bhojan Mitra or delivery connectors.</li>
      <li>Run a 2-week side-by-side trial where possible and compare reconciliation reports.</li>
    </ol>
